# Copykitt: Tutorial Project

This is a SaaS application that generates AI branding snippets and keywords for the customer's brand. 
It is a full stack application, and created as a tutorial for how to create AI driven full-stack
SaaS apps.

## Examples

Try out the demo here (requires authentication): https://www.copykitt.co

## Lambda Layer ZIP

I've decided to actually commit the Lambda layer zip file itself along with the project since a
few people have told me they have trouble building this Docker image themselves.

So you can either follow the tutorial and try to build it (it's easier on a Linux or Mac), or if
it doesn't work, then just use the `copykitt-infra/lambda_base_layer/layer.zip` file I have provided.
